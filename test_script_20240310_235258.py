'''""" This code defines a simple Python script that includes a class, MyClass, which takes in an initial value and provides a method to double it. The script also includes two functions, add_numbers and multiply_numbers, which add and multiply two numbers respectively, as well as a main function that demonstrates the use of these functions along with the created MyClass instance.

The code starts by defining the MyClass class, which has an `__init__` method to initialize the value attribute and a `double` method to return twice the value. The MyClass class is then used in the main function to demonstrate its functionality.

The add_numbers and multiply_numbers functions are defined next, each taking two arguments (a and b) and returning their result as an integer or float. These functions are also called within the main function to perform addition and multiplication operations.

Finally, a conditional block is used to run the `main` function if the script is being executed directly. This ensures that the demonstration of the functionalities will only happen when the script is run as a standalone program."""'''
