This program demonstrates the usage of functions and classes in Python. It consists of three main parts:

1. The `main` function calls various functions and methods to perform operations on numbers and objects.
2. The `add_numbers` function takes two arguments (x, y) and returns their sum.
3. The `MyClass` class has a method named `double` that takes an argument (self, val), doubles its value, and returns the result.

When the program is executed, it performs the following tasks:
- Defines variables x and y with values 5 and 3 respectively.
- Calls the `add_numbers` function to calculate the sum of x and y, and stores it in the variable 'sum_result'.
- Prints a message containing the sum of x and y using string formatting.
- Creates an object of class MyClass with value 10 and calls its `double` method to double the value, storing it in the variable 'doubled_value'.
- Prints a message containing the doubled value using string formatting.
- Calls the `multiply_numbers` function to calculate the product of x and y, and stores it in the variable 'product'.
- Prints a message containing the product of x and y using string formatting.
